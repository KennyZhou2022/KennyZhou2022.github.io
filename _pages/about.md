I am currently a doctoral candidate in Civil Engineering at [Donghua University](https://english.dhu.edu.cn/).

My research interests include ambient aerosol, street canyon flow, urban environment, indoor air quality, and indoor environment modeling.

I am seeking a postdoctoral position starting from 2024.
