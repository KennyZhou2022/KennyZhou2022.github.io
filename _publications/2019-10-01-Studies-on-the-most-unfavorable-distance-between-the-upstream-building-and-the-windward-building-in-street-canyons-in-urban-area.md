excerpt: 'Numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of the distance between the upstream building and the downstream building in street canyons (D) on characteristics of air flow and distributions of gaseous pollutants in the canyons. The simulation results showed that the wind velocities in the windward regions in the canyons did not change with the change of D. However, the wind velocities in the leeward and central regions decreased first and then increased with the increase of D, and the minimum value occurred when D = 90m. Correspondingly, the peak concentration of the pollutant in the canyons appeared at the same D, which indicated the most unfavorable value of D existed. In urban planning, it should be avoided as far as possible. When D was more than 90m, the larger the D was, the lower the pollutant concentration would be. When D was less than 90m, the smaller the D was, the lower the concentration would be, which could be benefit for both land-saving and traffic pollution reduction.'

However, the wind velocities in the leeward and central regions decreased first and then increased with the increase of D, and the minimum value occurred when D = 90m. Correspondingly, the peak concentration of the pollutant in the canyons appeared at the same D, which indicated the most unfavorable value of D existed.
