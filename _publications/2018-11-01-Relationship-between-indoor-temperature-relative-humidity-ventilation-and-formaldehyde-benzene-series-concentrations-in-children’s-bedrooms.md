excerpt: 'Objective To understand the relationship between indoor temperature，relative humidity，ventilation and formaldehyde， benzene-series concentrations in children’s bedrooms. Methods During March 2013-December 2014，indoor concentrations of formaldehyde and benzene-series were monitored on site in 454 children’s bedrooms decorated for more than one year，the relationship between them and indoor temperature，relative humidity，ventilation was analyzed. Results The mean concentrations of formaldehyde and benzene-series in these bedrooms were 21.5 μg/m3 and 33.5 μg/m3，respectively in whole period，27.7 μg/m3 and 42.4 μg/m3 respectively in winter，which were significantly higher compared with other seasons (P<0.01). The daily-averaged concentration of formaldehyde had significantly negative correlations with daily-averaged temperature in the bedrooms in autumn and winter，as well as relative humidity in summer and winter (P<0.05). No significant correlations were found between daily-averaged concentration of benzene-series and indoor daily-averaged temperature，relative humidity (P> 0.05). Indoor ventilation in winter was obviously lower compared with other seasons. Monthly ventilation rates had significantly negative correlation with indoor concentrations of formaldehyde in bedrooms (r=-0.651，P<0.05). Conclusion Indoor ventilation significantly effects concentrations of formaldehyde and benzene-series in the children’s bedrooms decorated for more than
one year much stronger than indoor temperature and relative humidity do.'
